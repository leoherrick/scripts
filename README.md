add the following alias to your .bash_profile

```
alias fresh_proj="ruby < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/leoherrick/scripts/master/fresh_html_proj.rb)"
```

once you do this... act like a boss and start a new project in any empty directory by typing the following command in terminal:

```
fresh_proj <name of directory>
```
